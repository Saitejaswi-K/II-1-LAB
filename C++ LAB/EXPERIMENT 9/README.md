Program to demonstrate Constructors & Destructors.

Algorithm:

Step 1 - Create a class with required data members and member functions.

Step 2 - Initialize variables using parameterized constructor.

Step 3 - Declare a destructor within the class.

Step 4 - Define the function outside the class using scope resolution operator.

Step 5 - Call the constructor and member functions in main program.
