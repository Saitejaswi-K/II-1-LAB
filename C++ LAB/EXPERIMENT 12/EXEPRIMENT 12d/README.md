Write a C++  Program on Abstract classes 

Algorithm:

step 1: Create a base class.

step 2: Create a pure virtual function.

step 3: Create a derived class of base class and create a member function with same function name as pure virtual function.

step 4: Create a base class pointer object and derived class object.

step 5: Store address of derived class object in base class pointer object.

step 6: Access derived class member function using base class pointer
