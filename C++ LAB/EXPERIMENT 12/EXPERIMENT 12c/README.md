Write a C++  Program to illustrate  concept of Virtual Functions.

Algorithm:


step 1: Create a base class with a virtual function.

step 2: Create a derived class with same member function name as base class.

step 3: Create a pointer object for base class and object for derived class.

step 4: Store the address of derived class object in base class pointer object.

step 5: Call derived class member function using base class object.
