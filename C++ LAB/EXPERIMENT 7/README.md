Write a C++ program using this pointer.

Algorithm:


Step 1 - Create a class with required public member functions and data members.

Step 2 - Call a parameterised constructor with local variables.

Step 3 - Inside the parameterised constructor use 'this' pointer to retrieve the object's hidden by the local variables.

Step 4 - Define the member functions with required statements.

Step 5 - Create two objects of the class with required parameters.

Step 6 - Call the member functions.
