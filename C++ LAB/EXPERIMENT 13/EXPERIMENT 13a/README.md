Write a C++ Program for divide by zero using try & catch blocks.

Algorithm:

step 1:Read the two variables say var1,var2.

step 2:Inside the try block check the condition if(var2!=0) and find quotient, else throw var2 as exception.

step 3:Catch the exception using catch(return type variable) and display required result.
