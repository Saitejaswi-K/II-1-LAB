Write a C++ Program for divide by zero using multiple catch.

Algorithm:

step 1: Read two variables say var1 and var2.

step 2: Within the try block check whether the value is equal to zero or not.
      
      (a)If the value equal to zero throw the value and catch the corresponding exception. 
      
      (b)Else throw the character and catch the corresponding exception.


step 3: Define catch() funtion in main program.

step 4: Read the integer,float and character values for the function catch().

step 5: Display expected result.
