Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h).

Step 2 - Create a structure with required member variables and data members.

Step 3 - Create a variable of the above structure inside the main program.

Step 4 - Then, read data into member variables of that structure using structure variable with dot operator.

Step 5 - Display data of member variables of that structure using structure variable with dot operator.
