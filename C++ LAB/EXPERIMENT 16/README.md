Algorithm:


Step 1 - Create a class say A with x as private data member, display() as member function, and a parameterized constructor.

Step 2 - Define the operator function as void operator +(A) inside the class.

Step 3 - Write respective code for void A :: operator+(A a).

Step 4 - Create two objects inside the main program and assign values to them.
