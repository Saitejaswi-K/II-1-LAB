 Write a C++ program to declare a class. Declare pointer to class. Initialize and display the contents of the class member.
 
 Algorithm:
 
Step 1 - Create a class with required data members and member functions.

Step 2 - Create required variables and pointer variable for the above class inside the main program.

Step 3 - Assign the address of class object to the above class pointer object.

Step 4 - Call the member function using class pointer object.

Step 5 - Assign values to data members of the class using class pointer object to illustrate data members access using class pointer.

Step 6 - Call the member function and display using class pointer object.
